= Continuous Integration

This repository uses Travis for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

On every commit and pull request, Travis runs the test suite and reports success/failure.

On every commit to the "dev" branch with passing tests, Travis builds and deploys the app's
Docker image to Docker Hub with the dev snapshot tag format, e.g. dev-1.3.0.

On every tagged commit to master with passing tests, Travis builds and deploys the app's Docker
image to Docker Hub with the Git tag (without the leading "v") as the Docker tag, (e.g. v.1.3.0 -> 1.3.0).

The following Travis environment variables are required for the Docker Hub deployments:

* DOCKER_IMAGE : The docker image name, e.g. AAFC-BICOE/seqdb-ui
* DOCKER_PASSWORD : The Docker Hub username, e.g. AAFC-BICOE
* DOCKER_USERNAME : The Docker Hub password, e.g. mypassword

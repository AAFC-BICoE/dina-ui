== Page Layout

All page components should be aligned with the navigation and footer elements. The `PageLayout` component should be used as the root element to enforce this structure:

[source]
----
<PageLayout titleId="splitSubsampleTitle" buttonBarContent={buttonBar}>
  ... Main content of the page
</PageLayout>
----

== Order of Components

The components on a page should follow this order: 

1. Navigation Bar
2. Button Bar
3. Header
4. Main Content
5. Footer

== Button Bar

The Back button should always be positioned on the left side and displayed as a link since it serves as a navigation element. 

Action buttons like `Edit`, `Create`, `Delete` and `Revision history` should be placed on the right side.

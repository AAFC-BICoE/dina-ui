== Page Layout

image::DINA_design_guidelines_page_layout.png[Navigation, button bar, header, and main content are all aligned together]

All page components should be aligned with the navigation and footer elements. The `PageLayout` component should be used as the root element to enforce this structure:

[source]
----
<PageLayout titleId="splitSubsampleTitle" buttonBarContent={buttonBar}>
  ... Main content of the page
</PageLayout>
----

== Order of Components

The components on a page should follow this order: 

1. Navigation Bar
2. Header
3. Button Bar
4. Main Content
5. Footer

== Button Bar

The Back button should always be positioned on the left side and displayed as a link since it serves as a navigation element. 

Action buttons like `Edit`, `Create`, `Delete` and `Revisions` should be placed on the right side.

== Header

. This is the main header text, depending on the page it will display:
.. List page: The plural name of the entity (eg. Assemblages)
.. View/Edit page: The name/identifier of the entity itself being edited. UUIDs should only be used if a name/identifier is nto set.
. Tooltips can be added to the right to describe the entity itself. Should be referenced from the DINA user docs.
. Group name will be displayed on the right only for viewing and editing records. It should be all capital letters.

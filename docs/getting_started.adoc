= Getting Started

Before starting, you will need to setup your dev environment:

== Node.js and Yarn

See dina-local-deployment https://aafc-bicoe.github.io/dina-local-deployment/#_prerequisites[prerequisites]

You can check which versions you currently have installed with:

----
node -v
yarn -v
----

== Installing dependencies

After you have downloaded all of the required tools, you will need to install the required dependencies needed to run the app.

It's a good idea to run this command when checking out a new branch since the dependencies might have changed.

----
yarn
----

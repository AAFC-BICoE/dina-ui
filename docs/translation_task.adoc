== To export to csv file

* To get the net items for translation ( instead of sending all entries in the file with some items having blank French translation), add a filter in messages-csv-export.ts as in below line:

[source,tsx]
----
const rows = keys.filter(key => english.messages[key] && (french.messages[key] === undefined || 
      french.messages[key]?.trim().length === 0 ||
    french.messages[key] === null )
    ).map<CsvRow>(key => ({
----

run 
[source,bash]
----
cd ./packages/scripts
yarn --silent export-intl-csv > messages.csv
----

* Open the csv and save as xlsx file, make sure the xlsx is able to be previewed

* Go to the translation site and clone the previous project (or create a new project), upload the xlsx file and submit, when translation is received or done, an email will be sent to the contact email.

== To import from translated csv file

* Go to the translation site and download the target translated file
* Make sure the column header has `french` instead of `fran√ßais`
* Open the file in windows excel and save it as `CSV (Comma delimited)` file.
* Import the file into the `/packages/script` directory.

Run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
cd ./packages/scripts
CSVFILE=messages.csv yarn import-intl-csv
----

* Verify there are no unexpected characters, e.g apostrophe are the same as existing ones etc.

= Building the app Docker images

seqdb-ui and objectstore-ui can be containerized using Docker. Typically the Docker build is done automatically by
CI/CD, and the apps should be run for local development using `yarn dev`.

You can run the following commands to build the Docker images:

From the top-level directory, install the dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
yarn
----

Go into the app that you want to build:

[source,bash]
----
cd ./packages/seqdb-ui
----

Build the app:

[source,bash]
----
yarn build
----

Build the Docker image:

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t myrepo/seqdb-ui:mytag .
----

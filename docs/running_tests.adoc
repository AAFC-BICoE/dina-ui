= Running Tests

== Run all tests

Run `yarn test` from the top-level dina-ui repo.

== Run individual tests



* From VS Code: Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner[Jest Runner] extension, which adds Run/Debug buttons to your test files.

* From the command line:
** Using just the file name: `yarn jest QueryTable.test.tsx`
** Using the full path (when there is more than one file with this name): `yarn jest packages/common-ui/lib/table/__tests__/QueryTable.test.tsx`

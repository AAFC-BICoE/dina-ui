= Performing write operations

This application uses React's context API to pass down a "doOperations" function which allows
you to perform write operations against the back-end API. doOperations accepts an array of
operations to perform, so you can submit multiple resource operations in a single transaction.

If one operation fails, the entire transaction is cancelled, and doOperations throws a string,
which is an aggregation of all of the error messages. This function relies on the back-end to
support JSONAPI's jsonpatch extension.

Here is a simple example of a component that uses the doOperations function from the context to
provide a button that creates a new Region with a random name and symbol:

[source,tsx]
----
import React from "react";
import {
  ApiClientContext,
  ApiClientContextI
} from "../components/api-client/ApiClientContext";

export class NewRegionButton extends React.Component {
  public static contextType = ApiClientContext;
  public context!: ApiClientContextI;

  public render() {
    return <button onClick={this.createRegion}>Create Region</button>;
  }

  private createRegion = async () => {
    const { doOperations } = this.context;

    await doOperations([
      {
        op: "POST",
        path: "region",
        value: {
          attributes: {
            name: `new-region-${Math.random()}`,
            seq: "",
            symbol: `${Math.random()}`,
            type: "PRIMER"
          },
          id: -1000,
          relationships: {},
          type: "region"
        }
      }
    ]);
  };
}
